This container is a custom ubuntu base image with an s6 overlay.

# [timstephens24/emby](https://github.com/timstephens24/emby-docker)

[Emby](https://emby.media/) organizes video, music, live TV, and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone emby Media Server.

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 8096` | Http webUI. |
| `-p 8920` | Https webUI (you need to setup your own certificate). |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=America/New_York` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-e UMASK_SET=<022>` | for umask setting of Emby, default if left unset is 022. |
| `-v /config` | Emby data storage location. *This can grow very large, 50gb+ is likely for a large collection.* |
| `-v /data/tvshows` | Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. `/data/movies`, `/data/tv`, etc. |
| `-v /data/movies` | Media goes here. Add as many as needed e.g. `/data/movies`, `/data/tv`, etc. |
| `-v /transcode` | Path for transcoding folder, *optional*. |
| `-v /opt/vc/lib` | Path for Raspberry Pi OpenMAX libs *optional*. |
| `--device /dev/dri` | Only needed if you want to use your Intel or AMD GPU for hardware accelerated video encoding (vaapi). |
| `--device /dev/vchiq` | Only needed if you want to use your Raspberry Pi OpenMax video encoding (Bellagio). |
| `--device /dev/video10` | Only needed if you want to use your Raspberry Pi V4L2 video encoding. |
| `--device /dev/video11` | Only needed if you want to use your Raspberry Pi V4L2 video encoding. |
| `--device /dev/video12` | Only needed if you want to use your Raspberry Pi V4L2 video encoding. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

## Umask for running applications

You can override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Webui can be found at `http://<your-ip>:8096`

Emby has very complete and verbose documentation located [here](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki) .

Hardware acceleration users for Intel Quicksync and AMD VAAPI will need to mount their /dev/dri video device inside of the container by passing the following command when running or creating the container:

```--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri```

I will automatically ensure the abc user inside of the container has the proper permissions to access this device.

Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:

https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

This is already added for the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the emby docker.

### OpenMAX (Raspberry Pi)

Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi OpenMAX will need to mount their /dev/vchiq video device inside of the container and their system OpenMax libs by passing the following options when running or creating the container:
```
--device=/dev/vchiq:/dev/vchiq
-v /opt/vc/lib:/opt/vc/lib
```

### V4L2 (Raspberry Pi)

Hardware acceleration users for Raspberry Pi V4L2 will need to mount their /dev/video1X devices inside of the container by passing the following options when running or creating the container:
```
--device=/dev/video10:/dev/video10
--device=/dev/video11:/dev/video11
--device=/dev/video12:/dev/video12
```

[![Docker Universal Mods](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?color=94398d&labelColor=555555&logoColor=ffffff&style=for-the-badge&label=universal&query=%24.mods%5B%27universal%27%5D.mod_count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flinuxserver%2Fdocker-mods%2Fmaster%2Fmod-list.yml)](https://mods.linuxserver.io/?mod=universal "view available universal mods.")

Using the linuxserver [Docker Mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods) to enable additional functionality within the containers. The list of Mods available for this image (if any) as well as universal mods that can be applied to any one of our images can be accessed via the dynamic badges above.


## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it emby /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f emby`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' emby`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' timstephens24/emby`

## Updating Info

Most of my images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. I do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose
* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull emby`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d emby`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run
* Update the image: `docker pull timstephens24/emby`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop emby`
* Delete the container: `docker rm emby`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)
* I recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:
```
git clone https://github.com/timstephens24/emby-docker.git
cd docker-emby
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t timstephens24/emby:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`
```
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

## Versions

* **05.12.20:** - Initial build. Based on linuxserver.io's image.
